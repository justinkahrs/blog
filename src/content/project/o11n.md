I didn’t set out to build a desktop app. I definitely didn’t plan on making a tool that reads entire projects, rewrites code, creates new files, and does it locally with no cloud dependency. But that is exactly what o11n became.
This is the story of how it happened — what worked, what didn’t, and what surprised me most along the way.

## The seed

Like many projects, o11n began with friction.
I was bouncing between editor tabs, browser windows, terminals, and a dozen ChatGPT sessions. Each time I wanted help from an AI model, I had to explain the same context again or paste huge chunks of code.
It felt like starting over. Again and again.
What I wanted was simple:
A way to talk to my codebase, not just individual files.
What I needed didn’t exist.
So I started building it.

## Early experiments

The first prototype was barely more than a file loader and an API call. I could point it at a directory, select a few files, send a prompt, and get back suggested edits.
It was messy. It duplicated sections. It hallucinated. It crashed constantly. But it _worked enough_ to realize the core idea had legs.
Local context was the unlock. Once the model understood my full project structure, the responses felt more intentional. Instead of isolated suggestions, I was getting proposals that touched three or four files — a refactor here, a new utility there, and a tweak to a type definition in a different module.
It felt like pairing with a developer who actually read the codebase.

## Interactivity mattered

The next challenge was safety. I didn’t want magical AI editing my files without me knowing exactly what would change.
So I introduced:

- Diff-style review
- Granular acceptance
- Multiple iteration rounds
  The workflow became:

1. Load code.
2. Describe what you want.
3. Preview edits.
4. Approve or reject.
5. Repeat.
   This felt good. Lightweight. Productive. Empowering.

## Local first

The turning point came when I realized the whole experience could be local.
No API keys.
No accounts.
No subscriptions.
Just open the app and start building.
This changed everything. People who were anxious about leaking their projects suddenly felt comfortable. The model worked on small and medium-sized repos. And because nothing depended on cloud infrastructure, the app just worked.
Offline. Simple. Fast.

## Designing the interface

The UI needed to feel:

- approachable to a non-coder
- expressive to a seasoned engineer
- quiet enough to not distract
  I leaned heavily on:
- Monaco for code editing
- MUI for flexible layout
- Framer for fluid animations
  The end result wasn’t flashy. Just clean. Calm. And focused on getting ideas into code.

## Sharp edges

No journey is smooth.
Problems I hit:

- Versioning and state management
- Edge-case file merges
- “Too smart” formatting engines
- JS + Rust interop
- Packaging and distribution
  Even today, o11n is opinionated. It expects projects to have structure. It won’t magically fix everything. Sometimes you need three or four refinement prompts to get the shape you want.
  But every release gets better.

## What surprised me

The biggest surprise wasn’t technical. It was emotional.
People who weren’t comfortable writing code suddenly were. Not because the AI did everything for them, but because the tool lowered the activation energy. They could iterate. They could play.
They could change something and immediately see the result.
It reminded me of the first time I used View Source in Firefox. Suddenly, the web went from mysterious to malleable.
o11n makes software feel clay-like again.

## The philosophy

o11n is built on a few core beliefs:

- Creation should feel playful
- Constraints invite creativity
- Local beats remote
- Tools should disappear
- AI should collaborate, not dictate
  This is why it’s still a desktop app. Not a service. Not a portal. Just a tool you keep on your machine.

## What’s next

As of this writing, o11n supports:

- Loading entire projects
- Context-aware prompting
- Multi-file edits
- New file creation
- Prompt history
- Offline use
- Rich preview
- Iterative edits
  Future work explores:
- Undo history
- Smarter refactoring assistance
- Better integration with version control
- Shared workflows and recipes

## Closing

o11n began as a frustration with context switching. It became a way to collaborate with AI on code — locally, intentionally, and safely.
If that sounds fun, try pointing it at a side project. Give it a small task. See what it makes. Then refine. Iterate. Enjoy the loop.
That’s where o11n shines.
Thanks for reading.
